!Series_summary	"Primary RNASeq data for progenitor, resident, and stimulated (C.alb, LPS, injury, APAP+ starved overnight and pIC) mononuclear phagocytes from fourteen organs."
!Series_overall_design	"RNASeq data for over 400 samples comprising of 130 populations submitted by 16 labs (both non-ImmGen and ImmGen labs) from 8 locations around the world for ImmGen OpenSource Mononuclear Project. Samples were sorted in these facilities using ImmGenâ€™s stringent ULI protocol and shipped to one location for library preparation and sequencing."
